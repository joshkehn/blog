I'm giving [hulu plus](http://www.hulu.com/plus) a try this week. So far we have initial disappointments of:

 * Not all shows are available
 * Verizon has [admittedly poor 3G speeds](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/03/verizon-att-iphones/)
 * And of course the realization that they actually expect you to pay for this. 

Since hulu bumped up the ad length from ~30 sec to ~2 minutes it's a bugger to wait through the ads on a mobile device, especially when you can't just flip over to something else while the ad plays out.
