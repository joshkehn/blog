I just got back home from representing StackOverflow at [Rutgers HackRU](http://hackru.org/). Saw some great ideas and connected with some very interesting people from other reps. Most interesting of all was getting a chance to look more at [Twilio](http://www.twilio.com/). First glance I took at it a few weeks ago it seemed like an interesting system &mdash; that required a lot of work to make it useful. A better understanding of the API resulted in a few random projects, notably an application that when sent a SMS message containing a phrase to a number would call you back with a random phrase, as well as adding your phrase to the pool of available ones. There are also also transcription services, voicemail, conferencing,  and more all accessible via a simple XML API. I recommend giving it a try if you haven't already.
