*Disclaimer: I try not to be repost other peoples content with minimal comments. The attraction is there, do not get me wrong. But when I read the same thing on four different blogs I get a little sick of reading it. That being said, there is a time when I have to give in. Given the multitude of news about everyone's favorite tech company (Apple) this is one of those times.*

Lion was released today. With it Apple [killed off the white MacBook](http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/07/sturdy-white-macbook-is-discontinued-in-wake-of-999-macbook-air.ars) and introduced new [Minis, Airs, and a Cinema Display](http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/07/apple-intros-new-mac-mini-macbook-air-cinema-display-with-lion.ars) loaded out with [Thunderbolt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbolt_(interface)). John Siracusa's comprehensive [Mac OS X 10.7 Lion Review](http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2011/07/mac-os-x-10-7.ars) is an excellent starting point to brush up on the 250+ features and improvements that can be found in the new operating system.

Like John, I find myself disliking of the Launchpad only because I am a [power user](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_user) in the most extreme sense. For the average user who is more methodically mouse oriented I can see it being a huge advantage. Everything is accessible from a common GUI that behaves *exactly* like the iOS app screens.

Stephen Hackett, who runs the popular [Forkbombr](http://512pixels.net/)[^1] blog, has his own [OS X Lion Review on macgasm](http://www.macgasm.net/2011/07/19/lion-review/). I share most of his views, but one thing that struck me as especially poignant was UI changes to iCal and Address Book.

I fully agree with this sentiment. *Why indeed?* There should be no semblance to physical items. Physical items are created with physical constraints in mind. There is no reason for the digital representation to be similarly confined except to invoke a feeling of nauseating nostalgia.

Both reviews end in a similar fashion of agreement. Mac OS X Lion is a worthwhile upgrade with features and improvements that more then justify the $29.99 price.

In other news, Apple's financial results came out yesterday. The big news? Apple has money. *Lots* of it. They just reported record sales and profits for Q3 2011.

> On Tuesday, the company reported sales of $28.57 billion and net profit of $7.31
> billion for the three-month period ended June 25, 2011.
>
>The sales and profit figures-both quarterly records-increased last year's third-quarter
> performance by 82 percent and 125 percent, respectively.

Massive profit and sale gains. Not unheard of for Apple, if anything it is expected.

> Apple's cash and marketable securities increased to $76,156,000,000. The increase
> was 15% sequentially or $10.4 billion in three months. That's the equivalent of an
> increase of $11 per share (to a current $81.2/share.)

Take a look at the quick [WolframAlpha comparison between Apple and Exxon Mobile](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=apple+vs+exxon+mobile).

> Apple's market cap is now just under $350 billion. Meanwhile, Exxon's
