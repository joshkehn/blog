Gmail *far* more private then [Google+](http://www.google.com/intl/en/+/learnmore/index.html) will ever be. 

Viewing social networks as repositories of private information is the wrong way to view them. View them as public repositories of information you want to share with other people.

As for me, [I'm now on Google+](https://plus.google.com/106159272966839277787/posts).
