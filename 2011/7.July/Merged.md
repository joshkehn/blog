A while back I noticed that the `boolean` tests for [Vows](http://vowsjs.org/) weren't actually implemented. I [forked the repository](https://github.com/joshkehn/vows) on GitHub and [implemented them](https://github.com/joshkehn/vows/commit/db608e2e49461dd93c9a34b0cb4388200352b9e0), submitting a pull request afterwards. Then I promptly forgot about it. 

I was poking around GitHub the other day and remembered that pull request. Crawling back in the history I noticed that a little over a week ago [my request got pulled into the master branch](https://github.com/cloudhead/vows/commit/5b770a4af0f9a29e3db59b71a39026f029797580). 

Might not be big news to anyone else, but I think it's cool. Hopefully this helps motivate me to give back into the community more often. GitHub makes managing these changes much easier. It is as simple as fork, update, and submit a pull request. Changes are shown inline and reviewable by everyone who wants to merge.
