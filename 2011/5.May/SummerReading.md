I've taken reading up again, after putting it down for the past few years. This is my quick summer reading list, note books with a green <span class="read">&#x2713;</span> have already been read.

 * [The Count of Monte Cristo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo) (Unabridged)
 * [A Game of Thrones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Game_of_Thrones)
 * [Perfume: The Story of a Murderer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfume_(novel)) <span class="read">&#x2713;</span>
 * [Let The Right One In](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_the_Right_One_In) <span class="read">&#x2713;</span>
 * [Rastlin Chronicles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Raistlin_Chronicles#Raistlin_Chronicles)
 * [Dragons of Autumn Twilight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragons_of_Autumn_Twilight) <span class="read">&#x2713;</span>
 * [Dragons of Winter Night](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragons_of_Winter_Night)
 * [Dragons of Spring Dawning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragons_of_Spring_Dawning)
 * [Dragons of Summer Flame](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragons_of_Summer_Flame)
 * [The Bourne Ultimatum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bourne_Ultimatum)
 * [Behold the Man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behold_the_Man)
 * [Crime and Punishment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_and_Punishment)

These can all be found in the traditional paper form, which is my preferred medium for reading. The E-Ink screens found on many dedicated readers are quite nice. However, there is something to say about physically flipping pages and using your MetroCart as a bookmark.
