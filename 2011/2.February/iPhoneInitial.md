Having not bought into the Android craze I was in a good position to pony up and [pre-order the Verizon iPhone 4](http://joshuakehn.com/blog/view/34/Pre-ordered-the-iPhone-4-on-Verizon). I received it Monday and have been touting it around all week in my [Saddleback Leather Pouch](http://www.saddlebackleather.com/categories/108). I also did order an [Otterbox Defender](http://www.otterbox.com/iPhone-4-Defender-Series-Case/APL2-I4XXX,default,pd.html) because the reviews were great and I want to try something with a bit more protection then a simple pouch.

#### Feature Set

All the same features of the AT&T iPhone 4 along with the (for now) Verizon exclusive personal wi-fi network. For another $20 / month I have the ability to generate a personal wireless network that can handle up to five separate devices. The standard Bluetooth and USB options are available as well. Compared to my previous [brick of a phone](http://www.casiogzone.com/brigade/) the iPhone is predictably snappier to respond, has all the apps as my iPod Touch (+GPS enabled maps), and allows me to be completely mobile and still be connected to everything. This means I don't even have to think about lugging my laptop around. If I *really need to be typing* I have [Dropbox](http://joshuakehn.com/blog/view/31/Save-it-for-later-Dropbox-Evernote-and-Instapaper) and [a bluetooth keyboard](http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2010/04/08/finally-bluetooth-keyboard-support-for-the-iphone/) that lets me type as much as I want and have it available on any computer.

#### Speed Concerns

Some people mention that Verizon has slower 3G speeds then AT&T. I put forward the notion that if you *don't have a connection* you don't have **any** speed. While my connection is sluggish compared to my home connection, I am able to do non-network intensive work on it fine. My SSH connections don't seem to notice the speed.
