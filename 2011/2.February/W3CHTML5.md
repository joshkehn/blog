{"title": "W3C Encourages HTML5 Adoption","date": 1297714495000}
++++++++++
[Webmonkey](http://www.webmonkey.com/) part of [Wired](http://wired.com) published an article that indicates the W3C is receiving a major push from within the industry to publish a finalized version of the [HTML5 draft specifications](http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html). It would also be good to note that [HTML5 is now simply HTML](http://blog.whatwg.org/html-is-the-new-html5). The "living standard" idea is a great idea. Continuous forward adoption with [graceful degradation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault-tolerant_system) for legacy systems is the way to go.

> Developers can use HTML5 now and we encourage them to do so,

Previously [it was stated that HTML5 wasn't ready](/2010/10/7/W3C-Holding-off-on-HTML5.html). I countered with the argument that *nothing* would ever be ready unless adoption continued to increase. [Google trends for HTML5](http://www.google.com/trends?q=html5) indicate that it's trending up.
