++++++++++  
Tested my [Atom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(standard)) feed a few minutes ago. With a little more spit and polish I will be rolling out my new site. With [startup weekend](http://twitter.com/joshkehn/status/101365582611484672) starting tomorrow I won't have time to clean up the loose ends.

I will keep `/blog` as-is for now. I don't want to haphazardly break links. A url rewrite will be put in place for the more popular posts, but the original path will remain for now. 

<strike>I don't suggest you depend on `/new` as it *will* change. The more adventure inclined can test out the [new feed](http://joshuakehn.com/new/atom.xml). Contact me if you find any issues.</strike> Everything updated! Still, let me know if you have any issues.
