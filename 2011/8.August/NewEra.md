The internet has exploded at the news of [Steve Jobs's resignation as CEO](http://joshuakehn.com/2011/8/24/Steve-Jobs-Resigns.html). [Wired](http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/08/jobs-resigns/), [TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/24/steve-jobs-the-patron-saint-of-perfectionists/), and [engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2011/08/24/steve-jobs-resigns-as-ceo-of-apple/)&mdash;to name just a few&mdash;have all pushed out rapid-fire articles detailing Jobs's many achievements, influences and [words](http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/08/money-quotes-steve-jobs-style/); Steve Jobs has firmly left his mark on our lives. 

Some have called it [the end of an era](http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/24/steve-jobs-the-end-of-an-era/). I disagree.

> Jobs’s greatest creation isn’t any Apple product. It is Apple itself.

Apple is not Steve Jobs; it isn't going away.[^1] It's just beginning. It's a sad beginning, but it is *not* an ending. 

[^1]: For that matter, neither is Jobs. He is staying on as Chairman of the Board.
