{"title":"New Domain Names","date":1314289052000}

I went on a bit of a domain name spree recently. After discovering the simple and efficient registrar [gandi.net](http://gandi.net) I went through and started picking up domain names. Here is a quick breakdown of what I have and how they are currently being used.

### kehn.io
This is a basic Input / Output page. It centers on 	inputs *to me* and outputs *from me*. 

### kehn.us
Family domain with email addresses. 

### joshkehn.com, kehn.co.uk, kehn.info
All just redirect to `joshuakehn.com` for now. I don't have any plans in the near future for them. Maybe some bland jokes about British folk.
