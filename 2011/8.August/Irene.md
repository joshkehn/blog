We're in for it.

First a [earthquake / aftershock](http://twitter.com/#!/joshkehn/status/106061914026688512) and now a [Hurricane called Irene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Irene_(2011)).

On news of the hurricane [my first impressions](http://twitter.com/#!/joshkehn/status/106905667742347264) involved luck-wishing and much laughter. Then I [shrugged off](http://twitter.com/#!/joshkehn/status/107143500738469889) the impending storm. Right now I'm just a bit [nostalgic](http://twitter.com/#!/joshkehn/status/107146306744619008).

Irene is categorized as a [Category 3 hurricane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale#Category_3), with sustained winds exceeding 110 mph.

> There is a high risk of injury or death to people, livestock, and pets due to flying and falling debris. Nearly all older (pre-1994) mobile homes will be destroyed. Most newer mobile homes will sustain severe damage with potential for complete roof failure and wall collapse. Poorly constructed frame homes can be destroyed by the removal of the roof and exterior walls. Unprotected windows will be broken by flying debris. Well-built frame homes can experience major damage involving the removal of roof decking and gable ends. There will be a high percentage of roof covering and siding damage to apartment buildings and industrial buildings. Isolated structural damage to wood or steel framing can occur. Complete failure of older metal buildings is possible, and older unreinforced masonry buildings can collapse. Numerous windows will be blown out of high-rise buildings resulting in falling glass, which will pose a threat for days to weeks after the storm. Most commercial signage, fences, and canopies will be destroyed. Many trees will be snapped or uprooted, blocking numerous roads.

New Jersey and New York have declared [a state of emergency](http://www.wnyc.org/blogs/wnyc-news-blog/2011/aug/25/hurricane-irene-barrles-toward-tri-state-area/). My home is planted firmly in [Zone A](http://project-s3.wnyc.org/news-maps/hurricane-zones/hurricane-zones.html) with a [standing mandatory evacuation order](http://gothamist.com/2011/08/26/nyc_starts_mandatory_evacuation_of.php) in place.

> Bloomberg said all residents need to be out by 5 p.m. tomorrow (8/27)—"If you can leave today, that would be helpful…At the moment the strongest winds are expected to arrive in the early evening tomorrow. It is expected to be a category 1 storm. The full brunt of the storm—if you are in its way—is a lot more powerful than any of us."

I'm really glad I picked up those [Pelican cases](http://i.imgur.com/kfyuo.jpg) now. Limiting the amount of stuff that gets water damage (if it does flood) will be nice.
