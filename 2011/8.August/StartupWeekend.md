I'm participating in [Startup Weekend in New York City](http://nyc.startupweekend.org/2011/07/30/august-startup-weekend-info/) on the recommendation of a few friends. The networking has been more enjoyable then the [idea pitches](http://twitter.com/#!/joshkehn/status/102167994314133504), though I'm getting [hit on more then most](http://twitter.com/#!/joshkehn/status/102151097195577344). The developer / business ratio is off by a fair margin. Good for picky developers, bad for people trying to attract much needed developers to their team. I know of at least one team that couldn't attract any developers.

Notes I took are available either in [interactive HTML format](http://joshuakehn.com/static/startup.html "NYC Startup weekend notes"), [plain text](http://joshuakehn.com/static/startup.txt "NYC Startup weekend notes"), or the [original OmniOutliner 3 document](http://joshuakehn.com/static/startup.oo3 "NYC Startup weekend notes").
