    "Your time is lim&shy;it&shy;ed, so don't waste it liv&shy;ing some&shy;one else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma â€“ which is liv&shy;ing with the results of other peo&shy;ple's think&shy;ing. Don't let the noise of other's o&shy;pin&shy;ions drown out your own in&shy;ner voice. And most im&shy;por&shy;tant, have the cour&shy;age to fol&shy;low your heart and in&shy;tu&shy;i&shy;tion. They some&shy;how al&shy;read&shy;y know what you tru&shy;ly want to be&shy;come. Eve&shy;ry&shy;thing else is sec&shy;ond&shy;ar&shy;y."
