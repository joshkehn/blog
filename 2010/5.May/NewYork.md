I have arrived in [New York](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York). Actually I arrived a little bit earlier, but I spent a lot of yesterday touring the city and wearing out my shoes.

The subway and [train](http://www.mta.info/lirr/) are not as complicated as they first appear. I've packed a train timetable and a subway map just in case though.
