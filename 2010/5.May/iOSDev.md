I've been meaning to try out some things like [Appcelerator](http://www.appcelerator.com/) or [jQTouch](http://www.jqtouch.com/) but haven't found the time. I'm going to leave a nice list of links that are probably helpful if you wanted to do this.

Primary motivation for me is if I have this list up here I might actually do something with it.

 * [Appcelerator](http://www.appcelerator.com)
 * [jQTouch](http://www.jqtouch.com/)
 * [PixelPads](http://www.pixelpads.com/PixelPads_I_Features.html)
 * [SmashingMagazine Article](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/05/28/web-development-for-the-iphone-and-ipad-getting-started/)
 * [CSS 3](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/05/27/css-three-connecting-the-dots/) (Also on [SM](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/))

Added two books (using a blog as a reading list, dear me)

 * [MySQL Administrators Bible](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470416912/ref=ord_cart_shr?ie=UTF8&m=ATVPDKIKX0DER)
 * [PHP and MySQL Web Development](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0672329166/ref=ord_cart_shr?ie=UTF8&m=ATVPDKIKX0DER)
