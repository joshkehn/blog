I recently got an email about [Kaleidoscope](http://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com/), another take on the various [diff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff) tools out there. This one is targeted to OS X users at present.

I'm giving it a test run, it seems to handle pretty well. I ran it through two ~690KB files (which had about 10,000 lines of ping results) just to test the speed. It didn't crash or stall, and only took a couple of minutes. Not bad at all, especially for a new application.


Compared to [Changes](http://connectedflow.com/changes/) it holds it own pretty well. Except for lack of folder support that is.

While I wait for [git mergetool](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-mergetool.html) support I will use it whenever I need a diff tool and note any quirks.

[SOFA](http://www.madebysofa.com/), the company that designed Kaleidoscope also makes [Versions](http://www.versionsapp.com/), a OS X [svn](http://subversion.tigris.org/) client. While I prefer [Cornerstone](http://www.zennaware.com/cornerstone/) from [Zennaware](http://www.zennaware.com/) I thought Versions was a decent take on a svn GUI client. That is until I found [git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29) and ditched GUI's.
