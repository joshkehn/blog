Actually, I abstain from veggie burgers. It's a complete oxymoron to say "veggie burger" when by [definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burger) and [construct](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger) it's a meat containing sandwich. 

The tortures of Javascript / pseudo-javascript code are over and we're on to bigger and better things. Hoping to write more later on it.

The Ignited-Blog is coming along well-ish. There are features I want to implement that I just haven't had time for. Specifically I'd like to overhaul the entire thing and include an installation type method, a better "admin" area, and a [live update](http://wmd-editor.com/). The live update (using either [WMD](http://wmd-editor.com/) or the [open source branch](http://github.com/joshkehn/wmd)) has been tedious at best. I'm not sure how it's being created / applied and I'm also not sure of the overall requirements. I was hoping to have time this weekend to tear apart the form and start building from scratch but that hasn't come to pass.
