I got to play with [Appcelerator's](http://www.appcelerator.com/) [Titanium](http://www.appcelerator.com/products/titanium-cross-platform-application-development/) and [Titanium Mobile](http://www.appcelerator.com/products/titanium-mobile-application-development/) applications today. Some interesting stuff, especially the Desktop based programs. Essentially it allows you to create rich, full featured applications with [HTML5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) ([W3C specs](http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html)), [CSS3](http://www.css3.info/) ([W3C](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work)), and healthy dose of your choice of Javascript. 

How does it manage to do this? On the desktop side it wraps up a [bleeding edge build](http://webkit.org/building/checkout.html) of the [WebKit](http://webkit.org/) browser engine and then simply displays as normal. On the mobile side it makes heavy use of the [API's](http://developer.appcelerator.com/apidoc/mobile/latest) that I find more in line with traditional [Java's JFrame layout](http://www.apl.jhu.edu/~hall/java/Swing-Tutorial/Swing-Tutorial-JFrame.html) then a Javascript application. 

While the documentation isn't strong (is it ever?), the technology is a *huge* boon to the [web developers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development) and [web designers](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/01/14/web-design-trends-for-2009/) who don't have either the time or inclination to learn [Objective-C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C) and all it's nuances.
