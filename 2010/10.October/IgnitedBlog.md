I pushed this code into the [Ignited-Blog](http://github.com/joshkehn/Ignited-Blog) repository on GitHub. Fork, branch, play with it all you want. Nothing really special about it. Very basic currently. I would love some feedback from people who are using it. I plan on having setup instructions by the end of the week, along with notes on usage and setup. 

Feature list:

 * MongoDB backed
 * CodeIgniter frontend
 * Integrated management (edit / comments)
 * Basic post functionality
 * reCaptcha comment checks
 * Markdown formatted
 * Post archives
 * Post downloads (Markdown / PDF)

Planned:

 * Plugins?
 * Multiple formats
 * GUI management of configuration options
 * Security bump
