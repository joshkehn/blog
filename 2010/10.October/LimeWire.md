LimeWire, the name often synonymous with illegal P2P file sharing, closed it's doors Tuesday following a [court ordered injunction](http://download.limewire.com/injunction/Injunction.pdf) after U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood issued a judgement in May that LimeWire knowingly allowed large scale copyright infringement.

LimeWire made use of the [Gnutella](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnutella) network, one of the first decentralized P2P networking models. There is a large number of [client programs available](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnutella#Software) on an equally large number of host operating systems. While LimeWire appears to be out of the picture for now, that is by no means a death-blow to the P2P concept the RIAA wants.
