Moved! I managed to get everything ported in under eight hours. I didn't even touch the old code base. The hacks I wrote to make everything work right were so horrendous I couldn't even stand looking at it. After mapping everything out on paper it took minimal time to get it all working. There are still a few adjustments to be made but those will come soon enough. 

### Specs (as redesigned):

 * Frontend HTML5 / CSS3 / jQuery (admin perks)
 * Backend in CodeIgniter / PHP 5
 * Database MongoDB 1.6.2
 * OS Ubuntu 10.04
 * Versioned: git

### Update

I've since moved to a [pure static file system](http://joshuakehn.com/2011/7/21/Static-File-Blogging.html).
