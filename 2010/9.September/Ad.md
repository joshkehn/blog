I picked this [YouTube clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cj2KAy2QS8&feature=player_embedded) up from [GothamGeek's blog](http://gothamgeek.com/post/1018542941/i-love-this-commercial-because-it-is-so-true-new) (which is run by Steven Martin of [Martin Tech Labs](http://martintechlabs.com/)) and figured I would re-post it here, if anything to keep tabs on it when I want to point people to it. So wonderfully true. I love New York City. Every day is something new and it's *never* boring.
