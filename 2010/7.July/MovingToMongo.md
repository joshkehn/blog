++++++++++
I'm moving this to Mongo. It has fulfilled it's purpose of building a blog (albeit one *slightly* better then the standard YABE) and now it's done. I have to get it to grow up. No more weird logins, no more weird inserts, no more tag table. 

Expect this to change in about two weeks or so. There *might* also be a change on the GitHub, depending on if I keep it CI (which I probably will) and how much changes (probably a lot).

Mongo will offer much more flexible (not to mention nicer) storage, inline tags, large posts, linked images, etc. All dependent on how much time I have to spend on this. You'll even be able to see previous posts past ten...
