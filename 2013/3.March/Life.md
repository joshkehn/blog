What *have* I been up to for the last six months? I last posted about [Scrambled Eggs](http://joshuakehn.com/2012/9/2/Scrambled-Eggs.html). Seriously? Yes. My last *real* post ([Grails in Production](http://joshuakehn.com/2012/2/9/Grails-in-Production.html)) was over a year ago.

The hell happened to me?

"Life" would be the terse one-word response that doesn't answer anything. Let's backtrack to last March.

### March

In March I ended up leaving a startup called Markover (now called [Poptip](http://poptip.com)). The original pre-TechStars idea was pin-pointed commenting over images. Now it's a dashboard for polling people on Twitter.

### April thru May

Had some fun with a side project called Showw.me and got to know the guys at [Singly](https://singly.com) really well.

### August

Left my job at [Freeverse](http://freeverse.com) and started [JAKT](http://www.byjakt.com) with [Anthony](http://www.byjakt.com/#about).

### August thru Now

Working my ass off and pushing a lot of stuff to the side. I turn into a disorganized mess at the slightest opportunity. Look at my desk, my room, or even the thousands of pictures I haven't processed, organized, posted, or even reviewed.

### Getting on track

I've got lots of things to improve on. TODOs and scheduling are the next big ones I'm hurdling. After putting it off for six months I put together a [blog](http://blog.byjakt.com) for ourselves and threw up an initial post [Dealing With Data in Python](http://blog.byjakt.com/tree-get.html).
