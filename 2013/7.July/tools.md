I got a [Potluck](https://www.potluck.it/users/new_from_invitation/7ccc0f68) notification from Anthony who posted about using [git-grep](https://www.potluck.it/rooms/0b01a651) instead of `grep` for searching. The [linked post](http://developingandstuff.blogspot.de/2013/07/grep-too-slow-tired-of-waiting-for-it.html) made a very good point about using stock `grep` to find bits of text in a project. Most noteably it's slow.

About a year ago I switched to using [the silver searcher aka `ag`](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher). Are you using `ack`? Pat yourself on the back, you're better than most. `ag`'s claim to fame is it's faster than `ack` and has a 33% shorter command name.

All this had me thinking that there are a lot of tools I use other people don't know about and vice-versa. Similar to [What OS X Applications do you find indispensable?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/82/10).

My short list follows.

 * `ag` of course for searching nearly everything.
 * Take some time and tweak your [.gitconfig](https://github.com/joshkehn/.config/blob/master/.gitconfig), [.vimrc](https://github.com/joshkehn/.config/blob/master/.vimrc), and [.zshrc](https://github.com/joshkehn/.config/blob/master/.zshrc) files. Little things like [git aliases](https://github.com/joshkehn/.config/blob/master/.zshrc#L77) save me fractions of a second multiple times a day.
 * Do you browse reddit? Grab the [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com) extension.
 * Favorite text editor? Hands down `vim` because it works everywhere. Want a GUI? [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) is awesome.
 * Supercharge your shell with [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) the easy to configure `zsh` installer from [Robby Russell](http://planetargon.com/who-we-are/robby-russell).
 * Everyone loves [Dropbox](http://db.tt/yd34jtG). If you don't use it yet, you really should.
 * Reading long technical articles is simple with [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com/).
 * [Fabric](http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.6/) makes automating simple commands easier. It's installed globally on all my machines.
 * [xkpa](https://github.com/beala/xkcd-password) for generating huge one-off passwords.
 * I was a massive [Quicksilver](http://qsapp.com) fan until I realized it's continued developement wasn't rock solid. Little bugs started getting to me, so I switched to [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com). That little butler hat can do anything.
 * Notes are always a hassle for me. [nvALT](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) solves most of my problems without being intrusive or overly complex. [Vesper](http://vesperapp.co) solves the same problem on my phone.
