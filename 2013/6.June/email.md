++++++++++

Life is entirely too short to waste getting push notifications from every single service in real time directly to your phone. This is part of the reason why I ride a motorcyle (more on this later). You absolutely cannot use your phone, your laptop, the radio, or anything else interactive while riding. Heck, I have to pull over, flip to neutral, and pull off at least glove in order to interact with any capacitive display.

When I'm working, I shut it all down. Phone goes on vibrate or Do Not Disturb, email gets closed, and most of my chat windows go silent. Anthony mentioned a while back how he's switched to checking his email only 3-4 times a day instead of constantly. Check email like you check for mail at your apartment. Unless you know something is coming, infrequently is best.
