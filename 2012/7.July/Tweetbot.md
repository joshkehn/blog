**It's here!**

I'm sure I've tweeted about wanting a better twitter client. After the failure of Twitter to support or even *think* about improving the "official" client I gave a few others a shot.[^1] They all completely underwhelmed me.

I loved Tweetbot on my iPhone and now I get to try it out on my Mac. I noticed a few different bugs, but so far I really like it. Go [snag the alpha version][tweetbot alpha] and read the [Tapbots blog post][tweetbot blog].
