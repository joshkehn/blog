2011 was quite the year. The [iPhone came to Verizon][jk iphone] early in the year, and later included Sprint with the [release of the iPhone 4S][apple 4s]. [`collabraCode();` made it's debut][jk cc] and had a successful pilot class. I started a [new job at Freeverse][jk freeverse] and [restructured my blog again][jk blogging]. Steve Jobs [resigned][jk sj] and then [passed away][apple sj] two short months later. A [famous piece of vaporware][jk tm2] was released.

That's a busy year.
