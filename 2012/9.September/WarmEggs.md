Eggs, scrambled, and slightly spicy.

## Ingredients

All ingredients are in ratio amounts.

* 6 eggs
* 1 small onion diced
* 1 bell pepper diced
* 3 dashes hot sauce
* 1 pinch of crushed red pepper flakes

Pantry items: Salt, Pepper, Olive oil.

Normally I do 3 eggs, &frac12; an onion, &frac14; green and &frac14; red pepper, 4 dashes of hot sauce, and a pinch of flakes. You can adjust to taste though. The point of the pepper and hot sauce is to add a little kick to it.

## Directions

1. Place pan on stove, turn burner to high.
2. Add a small amount of olive oil to the pan.
3. Wait a moment for the oil to become pliable; add salt, pepper, and the red pepper flakes.
4. After the spices have been evenly distributed in oil, add onions and peppers.
5. Lightly saut√© peppers and onions for a few minutes.
6. Lower heat to &frac12; power.
7. Crack eggs directly into the pan. If you wish, you can substitute some eggs for an appropriate amount of egg whites. **Do not mix in yet**.
9. Add dashes of hot sauce. Do not over apply hot sauce. Less is more here. Add any additional salt and pepper to taste.
10. Lightly mix everything. Do not over mix; do not scramble. Break yokes, but do not heavily mix yokes in.
11. Cook eggs as desired.
12. Plate and serve.
